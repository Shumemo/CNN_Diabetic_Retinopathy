Diabetic Retinopathy CNN

Here I am working on a personal project using a CNN to classify Diabetic Retinopathy images.
I am using this project as a learning process into how CNNs work, and on how to improve upon the CNN as I learn and read more.

I will compare a transfer learning build with one built slowly from scratch in classifying these images.

There will be clear markdown in the notebook as I continue to work on this to make every step as clear as possible, such that anyone can go into this and understand my step-by-step thought process into why I am doing what I am doing, and how I am interpreting the results.

I chose to do this because I am a Type 1 Diabetic myself, and was interested in using Machine Learning and Deep Learning to navigate the ways in which it can improve the outcome of those with Diabetes. And of course, because Machine Learning is so interesting to read about!

This is all about a slow, curiousity filled journey.

Another curious update incoming!
